Adele has postponed her entire Las Vegas residency, just 24 hours before the opening night.
"I'm so sorry, but my show ain't ready," the star told fans in a tearful update on Instagram.
"Half my team have Covid and it's been impossible to finish the show," she said, adding that "delivery delays" had also played havoc with her plans.
